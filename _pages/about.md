I'm a computer science PhD student and systems builder with a focus on large-scale graph processing, federated learning, and streaming inference. My work spans across building efficient, scalable architectures for dynamic graph data, optimizing GNN performance under real-world constraints, and exploring innovative strategies in distributed learning. I design and evaluate systems that bridge theory and practice—emphasizing runtime performance, memory efficiency, and adaptability to graph updates in real time.

Currently, I’m developing Ripple, a high-performance incremental graph processing framework. I also explore end-to-end pipelines that integrate CPU-based sampling, GPU inference, and hybrid memory strategies such as UVA and zero-copy. My research often involves custom datasets, benchmarking pipelines, and collaborative distributed environments using MPI, Redis, and Kafka.
